<h2>My Dearest Aduuu,</h2>
<p>
	Happy Birthday, my love. I don't know if you know this, you make me the happiest. You have always made me feel loved. You are one of the nicest human on this earth. 27 years ago you came into this world and I am glad I got to know you. And not just know you, I am lucky you called me yours. I wish you a lot's of happiness, success and joy! (a lot of craziness with me and your baby gurrrl!) </p>

<h2>My pineapple,</h2>
<p>I wanted to be with you today and make it memorable like you made mine. I know you'll be back soon and I'll be waiting right by the door. I can't wait to hug you again. (I am not letting you go for an hour!) I can't pamper you like you pamper us, so this is my way of telling you....</p>

<p>No matter how far you are, through ups and downs, I will be yours to bear. I wont ever give up on us. I know I will be hard sometimes, but I won't ever walk out. I am happiest and safest in your arms. I promise to irritate you till the end of time. Once again, happy birthday baby boii.
	I can't wait to hold you again. Come home soon!
