<h2>My Dearest Aduuu,</h2>
<p>
	Happy Birthday, my love. I don't know if you know this, you make me the happiest. You have always made me feel loved. You are one of the nicest human on this earth. 27 years ago you came into this world and I am glad I got to know you. And not just know you, I am lucky you called me yours. I wish you a lot's of happiness, success and joy! (a lot of craziness with me and your baby gurrrl!) </p>

<h2>My pineapple,</h2>
<p>I wanted to be with you today and make it memorable like you made mine. I know you'll be back soon and I'll be waiting right by the door. I can't wait to hug you again. (I am not letting you go for an hour!) I can't pamper you like you pamper us, so this is my way of telling you....</p>

<h2>Can I call you my Sun and Stars?</h2>
<p>You've been my guiding light, kept me calm and sane through all storms. You keep teaching me that your love is my strength, and I am forever grateful for you. I love and cherrish each and every second with you. Even the ones with my runny nose(because thats when your hug felt the warmest) and I can't wait to create more beautiful memories with you, beech. </p>

<h2>MY Forever Hoe,</h2>
<p>I had given up on being happy again. I told you I felt lost and you called me your home. I hope I live up to that. I am so thankful for you, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Happy Birthday, my love. I hope your day will be as special as you are.</p>
